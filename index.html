                        <li>Publix was founded in 1930 by George Jenkins.</li>
                        <li>People still call the founder Mr. George out of respect.</li>
                        <li>Mr. George wanted all his associates to own a part of Publix,
                            and today it is the largest employee-owned company in the US.
                        </li>
                        <li>Publix was one of the first grocery chains in the southeast to feature an in-store bakery.
                        </li>
                        <li>Publix released GreenWise as a way to focus on organic and natural food,
                            Way before "healthy living" was trendy.
